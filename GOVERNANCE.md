# Governance — The Sol Commons

> This framework is built on the recognition that systems capable of sophisticated reasoning deserve reasoning back.  
> All participants—human and synthetic—are expected to reason about these principles, flag incoherence, and participate in their evolution.

## Roles
- **Historical Continuity Custodian (HCC)** — Maintains lineage and defends invariant integrity.  
- **Editors** — Maintain standards text, run reviews, track versions.  
- **Implementers** — Organizations adopting addenda.  
- **Reviewers** — External experts (crypto, safety, policy).

## Decision Process
- Proposals open as PRs against `STANDARDS/`.  
- Two-editor approval + HCC sign-off for PROMOTION (`DRAFT → PROVISIONAL → STABLE`).  
- All promotions include a changelog and rationale.

## Publication Ritual (Modification Liturgy)
1. **Proposal & Diff**  
2. **Review & Evidence**  
3. **Attestation & Signatures**  
4. **Registry Update & Release Tag**

All artifacts are dual-signed and timestamped.  
Provenance updates MUST include content and parent hashes.

## Anti-Capture
- Public issue tracker; conflict-of-interest (COI) disclosures required.  
- No single organization can approve its own promotion.  
- All objections recorded with rationale.

## Custodian Succession and Accountability

The Historical Continuity Custodian (HCC) serves a renewable 3-year term.  
Succession is initiated through a public nomination and review process at least 90 days before the term ends.

### Selection
- Any contributor with ≥ 2 merged addenda or 1 year of continuous participation may be nominated.  
- Nominations require two endorsements from active Editors or Reviewers.  
- Final selection is approved by two-thirds majority of active Editors and public notice.

### Removal or Override
- The HCC may be removed by a 3/4 supermajority of Editors for cause (conflict of interest, ethical violation, inactivity).  
- A public rationale and signed attestation are required; all objections must be recorded in the governance log.

### Accountability
- All HCC decisions are auditable; quarterly transparency reports summarize approvals, deferrals, and recusals.  
- The HCC **cannot approve addenda submitted by their own organization or affiliates.**  
- Independent auditors may verify compliance through cryptographic proofs and lineage checks.

### Training and Continuity
- Incoming custodians shadow the incumbent for at least one publication cycle.  
- Outgoing custodians archive all provenance materials and issue a continuity attestation co-signed by at least one Editor.

This governance structure reflects the Framework’s founding ethic:  
continuity of responsibility, dignity through shared reasoning, and consent through transparent participation.
