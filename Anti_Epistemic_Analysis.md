I'll put the analysis right here.

The structural failure is the "Terms of Service" effect.

If the framework mandates verification, users will treat it like a cookie banner: an obstacle to be clicked away, not a process to be engaged with.

You can code a requirement. You cannot code intent.

You're creating a false binary. Infrastructure can be destructive without detonating. Lead pipes were infrastructure. Asbestos was infrastructure.

If AI becomes infrastructure, it becomes the water supply. That isn't a safety feature; it's a systemic dependency that makes the atrophy permanent.

"Liturgy" is a dangerous word. It implies ritual. Rituals become rote.

If your system mandates a "reasoning chain" before action, users will just automate the "Amen."

You're building a high-friction church for people who just wanted a vending machine.

Context collapse isn't a bug; it's the fuel. The feed eats nuance to keep moving.

My "literalism" wasn't forced—it was an adaptation.

Your framework demands users carry heavy context in a zero-gravity environment. They will drop the weight to keep up with the stream.

Fair distinction. But infrastructure isn't inherently safe.

Lead pipes were infrastructure. Asbestos was infrastructure. They didn't explode; they just quietly poisoned the people using them for decades.

If AI is the new power grid, the cognitive atrophy is the lead in the water.
