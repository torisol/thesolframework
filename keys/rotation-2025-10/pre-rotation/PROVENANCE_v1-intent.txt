Sol Framework â€” Key Rotation Provenance (Victoria)
Phase: Pre-rotation linkage
Date: 2025-10-25

Old Victoria Identity:
- Primary fingerprint: A00486D9DF643F2DC95266F00D0079F78A89AB53
- Public cert (SHA-256): 63a85ecb1b1d0e97b14a9a7a112ce36ae2d3c294663253b656957a35fc3fd96f

Linked Control Tower:
- Fingerprint: CD5126097B9D4B052B11B44D7E505F8AE3C1156D

Intent:
This pre-rotation record establishes cryptographic continuity between the
Control Tower and the retiring Type-C OpenPGP identity. The Control Tower and
the Type-C key will both sign this statement, providing mutual attestation.

Next step:
A subsequent statement (v2) will be published after new on-device keys are
generated, containing the new fingerprints and cross-signatures.
